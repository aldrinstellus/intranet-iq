# IT Security Guidelines

Protecting company data is everyone's responsibility. This guide outlines our security policies and best practices to keep our systems and data safe.

## Password Requirements

### Complexity Rules
- Minimum 12 characters
- At least one uppercase letter
- At least one lowercase letter
- At least one number
- At least one special character (!@#$%^&*)

### Password Best Practices
- **Never reuse passwords** across different accounts
- **Use a password manager** (we provide 1Password for all employees)
- **Change passwords** every 90 days
- **Never share passwords** via email, chat, or phone

## Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

2FA is **required** for all employees. We support:

1. **Authenticator Apps** (Recommended)
   - Google Authenticator
   - Authy
   - Microsoft Authenticator

2. **Hardware Keys**
   - YubiKey (provided to all employees)
   - Request at IT help desk

3. **SMS** (Last resort only)
   - Less secure than other methods
   - Only use if other options unavailable

### Setting Up 2FA
1. Go to Settings → Security
2. Click "Enable 2FA"
3. Scan QR code with authenticator app
4. Enter verification code
5. Save backup codes securely

## Data Classification

| Level | Description | Examples |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| **Public** | Can be shared externally | Marketing materials, public docs |
| **Internal** | Company-wide access | Policies, org charts |
| **Confidential** | Need-to-know basis | Customer data, financials |
| **Restricted** | Highly sensitive | PII, credentials, legal |

## Device Security

### Company Devices
- Full disk encryption enabled
- Automatic screen lock (5 min)
- Remote wipe capability
- Approved software only

### Personal Devices (BYOD)
- Must register with IT
- Install MDM profile
- Separate work/personal data
- Report loss immediately

## Reporting Security Incidents

If you suspect a security incident:

1. **Don't panic** - but act quickly
2. **Report immediately** to security@digitalworkplace.ai
3. **Preserve evidence** - don't delete or modify anything
4. **Document** what you observed
5. **Don't discuss** with unauthorized persons

### What to Report
- Phishing emails
- Suspicious login attempts
- Lost or stolen devices
- Unauthorized access
- Malware/virus infections
- Data breaches

## Phishing Awareness

### Red Flags
- Urgent or threatening language
- Requests for credentials
- Suspicious sender addresses
- Misspelled domains
- Unexpected attachments

### When in Doubt
1. Don't click links
2. Don't download attachments
3. Forward to security@digitalworkplace.ai
4. Delete the email

## Remote Work Security

### VPN Usage
- **Always use VPN** when on public WiFi
- Connect before accessing company resources
- Disconnect when not in use

### Home Network
- Change default router password
- Enable WPA3 encryption
- Keep firmware updated
- Separate guest network

## Compliance

We adhere to:
- SOC 2 Type II
- GDPR
