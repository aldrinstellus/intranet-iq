## [0.8.0] - 2026-01-22

### Added - Workflow Builder Upgrade (Glean-Inspired)

#### ReactFlow Integration
- Complete rebuild of workflow builder using `@xyflow/react` (ReactFlow)
- Vertical (top-to-bottom) layout for modern workflow visualization
- Custom node types: trigger, search, action, condition, transform, output
- Custom edge types: default and conditional (success/failure branches)
- Smooth step path connections with animated flow indicators

#### New Components
- `WorkflowBuilder.tsx` - Main container with ReactFlowProvider
- `WorkflowCanvasNew.tsx` - ReactFlow canvas with drag-drop support
- `ComponentPalette.tsx` - Right-side panel for adding workflow components
- `WorkflowControls.tsx` - Compact floating toolbar (undo/redo, zoom, auto-layout, save)
- `ContextMenu.tsx` - Right-click context menu for quick actions
- `BaseNode.tsx` - Universal node component with vertical handles
- `DefaultEdge.tsx` - Standard connection edge with delete on select
- `ConditionalEdge.tsx` - Yes/No branches for condition nodes
- `NodeConfigPanel.tsx` - Slide-out configuration panel for nodes

#### Workflow Templates (6 Rich Templates)
- **Employee Onboarding**: 6 steps (accounts → equipment → training)
- **Document Approval**: 6 steps (submit → review → approve/reject)
- **Data Sync**: 6 steps (fetch → transform → validate → sync)
- **Report Generation**: 6 steps (gather → aggregate → generate → distribute)
- **Email Campaign**: 6 steps (audience → segment → personalize → send)
- **Ticket Routing**: 6 steps (analyze → prioritize → route → assign)

#### State Management
- Zustand store for workflow state (`src/lib/workflow/store.ts`)
- Full undo/redo history with 50-step limit
- Copy/paste/duplicate nodes support
- Multi-select with Shift+Click
- Auto-save with dirty state tracking

#### Keyboard Shortcuts
- `Cmd/Ctrl + Z` - Undo
- `Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + Z` or `Cmd/Ctrl + Y` - Redo
- `Cmd/Ctrl + C` - Copy selected nodes
- `Cmd/Ctrl + V` - Paste nodes
- `Cmd/Ctrl + D` - Duplicate selected nodes
- `Cmd/Ctrl + A` - Select all nodes
- `Delete/Backspace` - Delete selected nodes
- `Escape` - Deselect all, close panels
- `Enter` - Open config panel for selected node

#### Visual Design (Midnight Ember)
- Glean-inspired clean, compact UI
- Vertical workflow layout (top-to-bottom)
- Node colored accent bars (purple trigger, blue search, green action, orange condition, cyan transform, gold output)
- Animated connection lines when dragging
- Selection glow effects
- Minimap with node colors
- Custom scrollbars and focus states

#### Serialization
- `workflowToReactFlow()` - Database → ReactFlow conversion
- `reactFlowToDatabase()` - ReactFlow → Database conversion
- `convertLegacyWorkflow()` - Legacy trigger_config.steps support
- Vertical layout positioning for new workflows

### Changed
- Workflow canvas now uses top-to-bottom layout (was left-to-right)
- Node handles positioned at top (input) and bottom (output)
- Condition nodes have Yes/No handles at 30%/70% positions
- Template creation now shows full workflow in canvas immediately

### Fixed
- Templates showing empty canvas (now properly converted to nodes)
- handleEditWorkflow detecting database vs legacy workflow formats
- Edge source handles for condition nodes

## [0.7.0] - 2026-01-21

### Added - Performance Optimization Release

#### React Query Integration
- Installed `@tanstack/react-query` v5.x for client-side data caching
- Created `QueryProvider` with optimized defaults (30s stale, 5min cache)
- Created `useQueryHooks.ts` with centralized query keys
- Automatic request deduplication across components
- Stale-while-revalidate pattern for instant navigation

#### API Route Optimizations
- **Dashboard API**: Parallelized 5 queries with `Promise.all()` (~3-5x faster)
- **Content API**: Query-level filtering (categoryId, status, limit, offset)
- **People API**: Query-level filtering (departmentId, search, limit, offset)
- Fixed cross-schema joins (diq schema -> public.users)
- Added `Cache-Control` headers for edge caching

#### Client-Side Optimizations
- Memoized `transformedEmployees` with `useMemo`
- Created O(1) lookup maps for org chart child finding
- Memoized `buildOrgTree` to prevent O(n^2) rebuilds

#### New Files
- `src/lib/providers/QueryProvider.tsx` - React Query configuration
- `src/lib/hooks/useQueryHooks.ts` - Optimized data hooks
- `docs/PERFORMANCE_AUDIT.md` - Performance verification checklist

### Changed
- Load times reduced from 10-15 seconds to ~2-3 seconds (60-80% improvement)
- Cached data loads instantly on navigation

### Fixed
- Cross-schema FK join errors between `diq` and `public` schemas
- Duplicate API requests on component re-renders
