## [2.5.2] - 2026-01-30

### Three-Panel Layout Fix (CRITICAL - Sidebar Navigation Visibility)

This release fixes a critical layout issue where sidebar navigation items were being cut off. Only bottom icons (Search, Notifications, Settings) were visible while middle navigation items (Home, Chat, My Day, etc.) were hidden.

#### Root Cause Identified
The combination of `h-dvh overflow-hidden` on parent elements created viewport calculation issues that prevented the fixed sidebar from rendering correctly:
- `body` had `h-dvh overflow-hidden` - locking document height
- Dashboard container had `h-dvh overflow-hidden` - double constraint
- Main content had `h-dvh overflow-y-auto` - conflicting scroll context

#### Solution: Decoupled Three-Panel Architecture
```
+----------+---------------------------+----------+
| Sidebar  |     Main Content          | Apps Bar |
| (fixed)  |     (scrollable)          | (fixed)  |
| 64px     |     flex-1                | 80px     |
| h-dvh    |     min-h-dvh             | h-dvh    |
+----------+---------------------------+----------+
```

Each panel is now independently positioned and sized:
- **Sidebar**: `fixed left-0 top-0 h-dvh` - manages own height/scroll
- **Main**: `min-h-dvh` - content determines height, body handles scroll
- **Apps Bar**: `fixed top-0 right-0 h-full` - manages own height/scroll

#### Files Modified (3 Critical Changes)

| File | Line | Before | After |
|------|------|--------|-------|
| `layout.tsx` | 36 | `h-dvh overflow-hidden` | `min-h-dvh` |
| `dashboard/page.tsx` | 268 | `h-dvh overflow-hidden` | `min-h-dvh` |
| `dashboard/page.tsx` | 272 | `h-dvh overflow-y-auto` | `min-h-dvh` |

#### Key Principles (MUST FOLLOW)
1. **Never use `overflow-hidden` on body** - breaks fixed children
2. **Use `min-h-dvh` not `h-dvh`** for containers - allows content growth
3. **Fixed panels manage their own height** - `h-dvh` or `h-full` on the fixed element itself
4. **Dynamic viewport height** - `dvh` not `vh` for mobile compatibility

#### Verification Checklist
- [ ] All sidebar items visible (Home, Chat, My Day, News, Events, Channels, People, Content, Agents, Admin items, Search, Notifications, Settings)
- [ ] Sidebar visible at 1920x1080
- [ ] Sidebar visible at 1366x768
- [ ] Sidebar visible at 1280x800
- [ ] Main content scrolls independently
- [ ] Apps bar scrolls independently

#### Prevention Notes
**DO NOT** add `overflow-hidden` to:
- `<body>` element
- Root dashboard container
- Any parent of fixed elements

**ALWAYS** test at multiple viewport sizes before deploying layout changes.

## [2.5.1] - 2026-01-30

### Apps Bar Drag-to-Scroll & Responsive Layout Fix

This patch adds premium UX drag-to-scroll functionality to the Apps Bar and fixes viewport responsiveness issues.

#### Apps Bar Enhancements (AppShortcutsBar.tsx)
- **Drag-to-Scroll**: Click-hold-drag to scroll through apps vertically
- **Wheel Scroll**: Mouse wheel scrolls apps independently from main content
- **Hidden Scrollbar**: Clean premium UX with no visible scrollbar
- **Click Navigation Preserved**: 5px movement threshold differentiates drag vs click
- **Cursor Feedback**: Shows grab/grabbing cursor during interaction
- **Click Prevention During Drag**: Uses ref-based tracking to prevent accidental navigation

#### Sidebar Responsiveness Fix (Sidebar.tsx)
- **Dynamic Viewport Height**: Changed from `h-screen` to `h-dvh` for better mobile browser support
- **Overflow Handling**: Navigation area now has `overflow-y-auto` with `scrollbar-hide`
- **Flex Shrink Control**: Logo and bottom actions have `flex-shrink-0` to prevent compression
- **Minimum Height**: Navigation uses `min-h-0` for proper flex overflow behavior

#### CSS Utilities Added (globals.css)
- **`.scrollbar-hide`**: Cross-browser scrollbar hiding utility class
  - `-ms-overflow-style: none` for IE/Edge
  - `scrollbar-width: none` for Firefox
  - `::-webkit-scrollbar { display: none }` for Chrome/Safari/Opera

#### Browser Automation Notes
- **Viewport Initialization**: Always set viewport size explicitly with `page.setViewportSize()`
- **Recommended Sizes**: 1920x1080 (desktop), 1366x768 (laptop), 1280x800 (small desktop)
- **Null Viewport Issue**: If viewport is null, browser may show tablet-sized view

#### Files Modified
- `src/components/dashboard/AppShortcutsBar.tsx` - Drag-to-scroll implementation (+60 lines)
- `src/components/layout/Sidebar.tsx` - Responsive height and overflow fixes
- `src/app/globals.css` - Added `.scrollbar-hide` utility class

## [1.1.2] - 2026-01-27

### Cache Prevention Configuration

Added permanent cache-busting to prevent stale deployments.

#### What's Configured

```typescript
// next.config.ts
generateBuildId: async () => {
  return `build-${Date.now()}`;
},

async headers() {
  return [{
    source: '/((?!_next/static|_next/image|favicon.ico).*)',
    headers: [
      { key: 'Cache-Control', value: 'no-store, must-revalidate' },
    ],
  }];
}
```

#### What This Prevents
- Stale JavaScript after deployments
- Browser showing old content after code changes
- Need for users to hard-refresh manually

#### Files Modified
- `next.config.ts` - Added generateBuildId and Cache-Control headers
- `CLAUDE.md` - Added cache prevention documentation
- `context.md` - Added cache prevention section

#### Verification
```bash
curl -I https://diq.digitalworkplace.ai/diq/dashboard
# Should see: cache-control: no-store, must-revalidate
```
